## Quick Start

### 🪟 Windows (Easiest Method)

**For users who want to just double-click and run:**

1. **Download the project:**
   - Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `C:\javinizer-js`)

git clone https://github.com/AlaricRomeo/Javinizer-JS.git
cd Javinizer-JS

# Run the setup script
./start.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual installation**

1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (or use `brew install node`)

2. Download and setup:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlaricRomeo/Javinizer-JS.git

### ⚙️ First-Time Configuration

After starting Javinizer-JS for the first time:

1. **Open the web interface** at http://localhost:4004
2. **Click the ⚙️ Settings icon** (top right)
3. **Set your library path:**
   - Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Videos\JAV`
   - Linux/macOS: `/home/username/Videos/JAV`
4. **Choose your language:** English, Italiano, or 日本語
5. **Click Save**

Your library should follow this structure:
```
/your/library/
  ├── [ID-001]/
  │   ├── [ID-001].nfo       # Metadata file (required)
  │   └── [ID-001].mp4       # Video file (optional)
  ├── [ID-002]/
  │   └── [ID-002].nfo
  └── ...
```

**Note:** Video files are optional - Javinizer-JS works with NFO files only if you prefer.

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize your setup:

```json
{
  "libraryPath": "/path/to/your/jav/library",
  "language": "en"
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **libraryPath** - Root directory of your JAV library (required)
- **language** - UI language: `en` (English), `it` (Italiano), or `ja` (日本語)

Additional settings can be configured from the web UI settings page:
- Scraper selection and priority
- Actor scraping settings
- Field-level scraper priorities
- External actor cache path (optional)

## Library Structure

Your library should follow this structure for best results:

```
/your/library/
  ├── [ID-001]/
  │   ├── [ID-001].nfo       # Metadata file (required)
  │   └── [ID-001].mp4       # Video file (optional)
  ├── [ID-002]/
  │   ├── [ID-002].nfo
  │   └── [ID-002].mkv
  └── ...
```

**Note:** Video files are optional. If not present, the system will show warnings but continue processing metadata normally.

## NFO Format

NFO files are compatible with Jellyfin, Plex, and Kodi:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<movie>
  <title>Movie Title</title>
  <originaltitle>Original Title</originaltitle>
  <id>ID-001</id>
  <contentid>id00001</contentid>
  <premiered>2024-01-01</premiered>
  <runtime>120</runtime>
  <director>Director Name</director>
  <studio>Studio Name</studio>
  <label>Label Name</label>
  <genre>Drama</genre>
  <tag>Tag 1</tag>
  <actor>
    <name>Actor Name</name>
    <role>Actress</role>
    <thumb>https://example.com/actor-thumb.jpg</thumb>
  </actor>
  <art>
    <poster>https://example.com/cover.jpg</poster>
    <fanart>https://example.com/fanart.jpg</fanart>
  </art>
</movie>
```

## Available Scrapers

### Video Metadata Scrapers

- **r18dev** - Scrapes r18.dev (automatic, fast)

### Actor Data Scrapers
- **javdatabase** - Scrapes javdatabase.com (automatic, with built-in caching)

## Web Interface

### Main Features

1. **Library Browser** - Navigate through your library items
2. **Metadata Editor** - Edit all NFO fields with live preview
3. **Scraper Integration** - Scrape and save metadata in one workflow
4. **Actor Management** - Dedicated page for managing actor data
5. **Settings** - Configure scrapers, language, and preferences
6. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket-based progress tracking

### Workflow Modes

The application supports different workflows:

1. **Browse & Edit** - Manually browse and edit existing NFO files
2. **Scrape & Save** - Automatically scrape metadata and save to library
3. **Actor Search** - Find and cache actor information

## Error Handling & Resilience

Version 1.0 includes robust error handling:

- **Automatic NFO Validation** - Invalid NFO elements are automatically detected and removed
- **Missing File Recovery** - Graceful handling of manually deleted folders
- **Warning System** - Non-critical issues (like missing video files) generate warnings instead of errors
- **Browser Cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of Puppeteer browser instances on Windows
- **File Lock Prevention** - Safe file handling to prevent Windows file locking issues

## Adding New Scrapers

Create a new scraper plugin in minutes without modifying core code:

```bash
# 1. Create scraper directory
mkdir scrapers/movies/myscraper

# 2. Create run.js (see SCRAPER_DEVELOPMENT.md for details)
# Your scraper just needs to export a function that returns metadata

# 3. Test your scraper
node scrapers/movies/myscraper/run.js TEST-001

# 4. Enable in web UI settings
# Add "myscraper" to enabled scrapers list

# Done! No core code changes needed
```

See [SCRAPER_DEVELOPMENT.md](SCRAPER_DEVELOPMENT.md) for the complete guide.

## API Endpoints

The application provides a REST API for integration:

### Items
- `GET /item/current` - Get current library item
- `GET /item/next` - Navigate to next item
- `GET /item/prev` - Navigate to previous item
- `POST /item/save` - Save NFO changes
- `DELETE /item/:id` - Delete item from library

### Configuration
- `GET /item/config` - Get current configuration
- `POST /item/config` - Update configuration

### Localization
- `GET /item/lang/:code` - Get translation file (en, it, ja)

### File System
- `GET /item/browse?path=...` - Browse directories

### Actors
- `GET /actors` - List all cached actors
- `POST /actors` - Create/update actor
- `DELETE /actors/:id` - Delete actor
- `POST /actors/search` - Search and scrape actor data

### WebSocket
- Real-time scraping progress updates
- Error notifications
- Status messages

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Install nodemon for auto-restart on changes
npm install

# Run with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

### Adding a New Language

1. Create `src/lang/XX.json` (where XX is the language code)
2. Copy the structure from `en.json` and translate all keys
3. Language will be automatically available in the UI selector

All UI elements use `data-i18n` attributes for automatic translation.
